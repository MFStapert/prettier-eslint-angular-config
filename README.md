# Angular code quality setup

A minimal setup for all the standard angular quality tooling, packages should be familiar if you work with web apps.

I don't modify angular's tsconfig, so it's not included.
Prettier config should make components a more readable with increased width, since angular is a more verbose.
The eslint config is aimed at using current angular standards.
Recommended settings should be enough for most use-cases.

## Setup

`npm ci`

`npx husky init`
